                <h1>Welcome to the game</h1>
                <p>The objective of the game is to beat Lewis Hamilton in the Championship.
                    Try to score more points than lewis, and you win! Easy right?
                    But watch out for the other cars and the oil patches!
                    If you crash you will lose points and if you crashed 3 times, your superlicense will be revoked!
                    Luckily you can avoid crashing by jumping over the cars and the oil.
                    Use the spacebar to jump.
                    Good luck in the Championship!
                </p>
